# Horizon Bridge Subgraph

This subgraph dynamically tracks assets and events

- aggregated data across managers, assets and wallets
- data on individual assets
- data on transactions
- data on managers
- data on wallets

## Queries

Below are a few ways to show how to query the horizon-bridge-subgraph for data. The queries show most of the information that is queryable, but there are many other filtering options that can be used, just check out the [querying api](https://thegraph.com/docs/graphql-api). These queries can be used locally or in The Graph Explorer playground.
